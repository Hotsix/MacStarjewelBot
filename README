STARJEWEL BOT FOR THE MAC OS X VERSION OF STARCRAFT 2 - README VERSION 0.9.1




WHAT IS MACSTARJEWELBOT? 
-------------------------------------

MacStarJewelBot is a bot (robot, auto-player) for the StarCraft 2 StarJewel mini-game,
created to beat the AI in Insane-Mode.

WARNING! DO NOT USE THIS BOT WHEN YOU PLAY AGAINST OTHER PLAYERS! BLIZZARD MAY CONSIDER
THIS CHEATING AND MAY PERMANENTLY BAN YOU FROM BATTLE.NET!!! USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!




HOW TO USE IT?
-------------------------------------

- Start Starcraft 2 in WINDOW MODE (1024x768)
- Start MacStarjewelBot 
- Create a game with the StarJewel mod map
- Press button "Start playing for me!" when the StarJewel playfield is ready

Once the bot started you can NOT use the mouse anymore because the bot doing all the moves
for you now. Simply PRESS RIGHT-MOUSE-BUTTON to STOP AUTO-PLAY.

Do not move the StarCraft 2 window after you started auto-play mode. If you do then you
have to quit the bot and restart it.




HOW DOES IT WORK?
-------------------------------------

The bot takes screen shots in an given interval and scans the image for matching patterns.
Once it found a matching pattern, it sends a global mouse event and does the move for you.




SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------------------------
- Starcraft 2 OS X
- OS X 10.6 

Source code:
- Xcode 4.x




REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS
-------------------------------------
•	Current playfield and gems detection is done per RGB pixel comparison which isn't very
	accurate. Possible improvements could be: 
	- manual calibration
	- advanced form detection algorithm  
•	Better jewel matching algorithm, the current simply checks for 3 row matches and
	doesn't check for 4er / 5er rows, cross combo rows or optimal moves to generate later
	combos. 
•	General code optimization
